real browser you can open pages, follow links, bookmark pages, submit forms, and many other things.

### Documentation

Complete documentation is available on [Read the Docs](http://www.gosurf.io).


### Credits
Go was started by [Sean Hickey](https://github.com/headzoo) (headzoo) to learn more about the Go programming language.
The idea to create Surf was born in [this Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/2efw1q/mechanize_in_go/cjz4lze).

Surf uses the awesome [goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery) by Martin Angers, and
was written using [Intellij](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and
the [golang plugin](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/5047).
